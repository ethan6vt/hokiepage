<h2>History of English</h2>

	<p>This spring I took the History of English with Joe Eska. The class was very informative and it helped me look at the English language in a new way. I particually liked learning about how lexicon and sytnax from other languages came to English from other languages.</p>

<h2>Topic in Literature by Women</h2>
		<p>The topic choosen for last semester's "Women's lit." course was "Women and Madness." Our primary text was Phyliss Chesler's book, "Womena and Madness." The course gave me a great look at the psycology of women writers. In addtion, we examined many different texts by women that were either considered "mad" at some point, or wrote about characters that struggled with some form of madness.</p>

<h2>Ethnic Literature for Children</h2>
		<p> This class was interesting because it highlighted many different ethnic issues/themes in children's literature that I would not have considered had I not taken the course. We also took a look at the structure and history of chilren's literature. This helped give me a renewed perspective on what a children's book really is.</p>
        
<h2>U.S. Government and Politics</h2>
        <p> This course fullfilled a free elective requirement I had for my Engilsh degree. I have an interest in politics, so I thought the class was right up my alley. The course turned out to be much different than I expected, but in a good way. Instead of learning the basics of government and politics, we read several deep works on theories of governemtn, governance, and current events. The class was heavily based on classroom dicussion, which is something I love. In fact, this class may be the best I've taken at Virginia Tech</p>
        
<h2> Internship at Christiansburg High School </h2>
        <p> Finally, last sememester I served as a teaching intern at Christiansburg High School. The experience was very eye opening, and gave be some great insight on what it meant to be a teacher in a public school. While I enjoyed it greatly, it did contribute to my decision to forgo my career path to becoming a high school teacher.</p>
